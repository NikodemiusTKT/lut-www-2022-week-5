    "name": "Pasta",
    "ingredients": ["100 g Italian grade 'OO' flour or plain flour", "1 whole free range egg", "1 free range egg yolk"],
    "instructions": [
      "Add all of the flour into a food processor and give it a whizz",
      "Add the whole egg and the yolk and blitz it until it resembles rice grains, about 2 minutes or so",
      "If it turns floury add a tiny drop of water",
      "Likewise, if it stays as wet dough, add a little more flour",
      "Once it's rice-like, knock out onto a lightly dusted worktop and knead into a ball, place in a bowl and cover with a dampened tea-towel for an hour or so",
      "Divide into 3 or 4 balls, placing unused balls back in the covered bowl",
      "With a rolling pin, roughly roll out each ball so it fits into your pasta machine, and repeatedly run through the machine, from the thickest setting, to the final thickness",
      "It's useful if you can hang the pasta over a skewer until it's ready to use or it tends to stick together",
      "In the biggest pan you have (10 pints water / 1 lb pasta) bring water with a pinch of salt, to the boil - no oil required",
      "Once on a rolling boil, add the pasta, a quick stir with a chop-stick or long spoon to prevent sticking",
      "The texture you should be aiming for is al-dente - a little resistance when you bite; rabbit like! This only takes a few minutes with fresh pasta",
      "Once al-dente, remove, drain and serve"
